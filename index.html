          <h2>Management Information Systems Student</h2>

          <p>As an graduate student, I am taking several courses involving programming, business analysis, cybersecurity, and product/process management. </p>
          <p>I am also currently pursuing certifications from LinkedIn Learning which are displayed on my LinkedIn profile. These involve HTML and CSS with hopes that I can complete more in the near future. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge about both the world of business and technology.</p>

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I was born and raised in Madrid, Spain. My family and I moved to the United States when I was 8 years old due to the global financial crisis. I was lucky enough to have a beautiful, hard-working mother that paved the way for me to be successful in life.
            After graduating high school, I had to move away from my family for a second time and move into the dorms at the University at Buffalo. I completed my first year as a computer engineering major. However, I was not happy with the updated curriculum I would've faced my second-year. I then decided to switch career paths and pursue a degree in Business Administration.
            I thought that by setting my concentrations to both International Business and Management Information Systems, I would get the most out of my undergraduate career. Thankfully, I wasn't wrong and enjoyed every class I took those last 3 years.
            Taking so many different types of classes, I found other areas of business that I liked, such as accounting and statistics. Having now graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, I do not regret a single thing.
            I am continuing my studies at UB for one more year in order to receive my Master of Science in Management Information Systems diploma by May 2023. Here are some of my favorite things I experienced while in college: </p>

            <h3>University at Buffalo International Fiesta</h3>
            <p>I had the privilege of performing in front of the entire school along with my friends from the Latin American Student Association. Dancing is something that I always found really enjoyable growing up and I am glad to have participated in this competition, twice!</p>

            <h3>Men's Soccer Club</h3>
            <p>Soccer has been my home away from home at so many different points in my life. Being from Madrid, I played soccer almost every day and now some of my best memories are with my soccer teammates. </p>

            <p>Having explored countries like France, Italy and (obviously) Spain, traveling has become a huge hobby of mine. My list of countries that I want to visit grows every year and I hope to continue exploring the world! </p>

          <p>I am currently working as a Student Assistant at the University at Buffalo and a Team Member at Whole Foods Market. Currently, I am looking for a new position that will focus more on the material I have learned as an undergraduate since I believe my resume lacks in that area.
